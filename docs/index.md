* [API Reference](api.md) - Endpoints and authentication (snapshots, simulate, graph, backends, plugins).
* [Architecture](architecture.md) - System design and modules (history, graph builder, simulator, connectors, plugins, security).

The Web UI now ships with a Projects Control Center to list, activate, and manage registered roots without restarting the server.
