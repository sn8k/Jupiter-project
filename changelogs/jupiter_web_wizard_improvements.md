# Web UI Wizard Improvements

## Added
- **Browse Button**: Added a "Browse" button (📂) to the Project Wizard modal, allowing users to select a directory from the server's file system.
- **Wizard Browser Mode**: Updated `app.js` to support a specific "wizard" mode for the file browser, which populates the wizard's input field instead of changing the root immediately.

## Fixed
- **Wizard Styling**: Improved the CSS for the Project Wizard modal (`#project-wizard-modal`) to match the application's theme (padding, borders, shadows, input focus states).
