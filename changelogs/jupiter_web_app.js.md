# Changelog – jupiter/web/app.js
- Rebuilt client logic with multi-view navigation, live log/event feeds, and reusable placeholder actions (Scan/Watch/Run/licence/langue).
- Added richer report rendering (status badges, KPI cards, derived hotspots, analysis stats, plugin grid) while keeping drag-and-drop JSON import.
- Provided sample report data, helper formatting, and safe guards for empty states across dashboard, analyse et fichiers.
