# Changelog – CHANGELOG.md
- Added version 0.1.1 section covering CLI exclusions, richer analysis summaries, and documentation updates.
- Added refactored static GUI with multi-vue dashboard/analyse/fichiers, placeholders Scan/Watch/Run, alerts, plugins grid, and refreshed dark theme.
- Remember the last served root across launches by persisting it to `~/.jupiter/state.json` and reload cached data through `/reports/last` so the UI stays aligned with the previous project.
